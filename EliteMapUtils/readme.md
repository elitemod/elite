## EliteMapUtils

This package is ment for map builders who want to keep their map portable throughout future releases.
It contains a dummy object that you can place in your level to define where the game objective (pole) 
should be placed. This was done because the embeded gameobjective is inside a versioned package. If you
would use the one from the EliteMod package you would bind your map to that version.

This package here will change less frequent, if ever, so please use the dummy inside this.

You can find it under NavigationPoint. More details for mappers will follow.
