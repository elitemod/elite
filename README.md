http://elitemod.info

## About

This is a modification for Unreal Tournament 2004 by Epic Games, Inc. A complete gametype
emulating the popular Shootmania Elite mode, which is basically a mix of Unreal's original 
Assault, Domination and Arena gametypes. A match of 6 rounds where 1 outnumbered player has
to either kill the opposing team or capture a gameobjective within 60 seconds. Each player 
gets to attack at least once match.
